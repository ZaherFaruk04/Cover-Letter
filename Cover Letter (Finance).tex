\begin{letter}{Hiring Team\\Ocorian}

\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

I'm writing to express my interest in Ocorian’s Graduate Programme. As a final-year physics student with hands-on experience in computational modelling and technical problem-solving, I’m excited by the opportunity to apply my skills in a financial services environment.

During my degree, I’ve worked extensively with Python, MATLAB and C++ - from simulating nonlinear dynamics to developing quantum algorithms for benchmarking cloud-based quantum platforms using QUBO solvers. I also led a drone engineering project in my second year - integrating embedded systems and hardware, while managing project coordination and system design.

Alongside technical work, I’ve developed strong documentation and communication skills, and I’m confident using Excel for data analysis - including PivotTables and VLOOKUPs. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and am motivated by Ocorian’s focus on scale, agility and collaboration.

Thank you for considering my application - I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute and grow with your team.

\closing{Kind regards,}

\end{letter}
