\textbf{Subject: Application for Graduate Software Development Engineer (Graduate Academy)} \\
\vspace{0.3cm}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing with great enthusiasm to apply for the Graduate Software Development Engineer position within the nFocus Graduate Academy. The opportunity to leverage my analytical background as a \textbf{Graduate Software Tester} and grow into a skilled \textbf{Software Developer in Test (SDET)} through your structured training programme is an exact match for my career ambitions.

My degree in \textbf{BSc (Hons) in Physics}, combined with my A-Level in \textbf{Computer Science}, has provided an exceptional foundation for a career in software quality. My studies have trained me to deconstruct complex systems, rigorously test hypotheses, and apply a first-principles approach to problem-solving. These are skills directly transferable to systematic software testing and debugging.

My project work demonstrates my practical technical skills and testing mindset:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advanced Problem-Solving (C++):} My \textbf{Drone Engineering} project required implementing real-time control algorithms in \textbf{C++}. The extensive \textbf{troubleshooting and debugging} of both software logic and hardware (Arduino) honed my persistence in isolating and resolving complex faults.
    \item \textbf{System Modelling \& Verification (Python/MATLAB):} I have used \textbf{Python} (NumPy) for mathematical modelling (Lennard-Jones Potential) and \textbf{MATLAB} for numerical solutions (Chaotic System Simulation). This work showcases my ability to \textbf{model complex systems} and, critically, to \textbf{verify algorithmic accuracy} against expected results.
    \item \textbf{Proactive Technical Learning:} My ongoing engagement with advanced topics like \textbf{Programming Quantum Computers} (IBM Quantum, PennyLane) proves my genuine \textbf{passion for technology} and my ability to rapidly learn challenging, cutting-edge concepts.
\end{itemize}

I am highly motivated to build upon this foundation through the nFocus Academy. The prospect of receiving $\pounds 15\text{k}$ of commercial training, including \textbf{ISTQB certifications} and expertise in \textbf{C\#, Java, or JavaScript}, is an exceptional opportunity. I am eager to learn from your industry-leading SDETs and contribute to the reputation of a multi-award-winning company.

I am a highly adaptable and collaborative individual, ready to meet the travel requirements and thrive in your team environment. My unique blend of scientific rigour and practical coding experience makes me a strong candidate for this role.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you further.

Sincerely,

Zaher Faruk
