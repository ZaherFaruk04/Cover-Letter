% --- OPENING ---
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Graduate Digital, Data \& Cyber Engineer role at Amentum for the September 2026 intake. As a Physics graduate from the University of Salford with a genuine passion for modelling, simulation, and software engineering, I am eager to help Amentum create a secure future. Your focus on advancing the future together aligns with my ambition to apply scientific rigour to solve complex digital challenges.

During my BSc in Physics, I developed the analytical thinking and data engineering skills that are essential for this role. I have extensive experience transforming abstract mathematical concepts into functioning digital solutions. For example, in my chaotic system simulation project, I utilised MATLAB and ODE solvers to model complex, non-linear systems. Similarly, my work visualising Lennard-Jones Potentials using Python demonstrated my ability to process large datasets and derive meaningful insights. This background fits well with Amentum's capabilities in modelling, simulation, and data science.

Beyond theoretical modelling, I possess the practical digital skills required to build and deploy real solutions. In my independent project involving the engineering of a drone, I acted as a systems engineer by designing hardware in Fusion 360 and writing the flight control algorithms in C++. This experience required technical coding proficiency as well as the ability to troubleshoot hardware and software interfaces to ensure system resilience. These are skills I believe are directly transferable to your software and data-centric solutions streams.

I also place a high value on initiative and curiosity. Recognising the future impact of advanced computing on cyber security and data, I proactively taught myself the fundamentals of quantum computing. By gaining hands-on experience with IBM Quantum and Microsoft Azure, I explored technologies that will define the next generation of digital resilience. This self-directed learning demonstrates my adaptability and my desire to keep pace with the innovation work done at Amentum.

Finally, my experience as an Office Administrator has honed my organisation and time management skills. I am accustomed to working in professional environments, managing conflicting priorities, and communicating clearly with diverse stakeholders. I pride myself on being a flexible self-starter and a collaborative team player who is willing to travel and work from various hubs to get the job done.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to launch my career with Amentum and would welcome the chance to discuss how my blend of physics rigour and digital passion can contribute to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
