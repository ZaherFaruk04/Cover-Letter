I am writing to apply for the Graduate Digital Intelligence Electronic Engineer role at BAE Systems. As a final-year Physics student at the University of Salford, I bring a blend of analytical thinking, practical electronics experience, and a strong interest in mission-critical technologies that align with the ambitions of your Digital Intelligence team.

In my second-year university project, I engineered and programmed a custom drone using Arduino and C++. I designed the circuitry, integrated electronic components, and implemented real-time flight control algorithms. This hands-on work taught me how to troubleshoot complex electronic systems, design for efficiency, and ensure robust performance under real-world conditions.

Alongside this, I’ve worked on data analysis and simulation projects using Python and MATLAB – including modelling atomic interactions and solving chaotic systems. These experiences sharpened my understanding of embedded systems, digital logic, and algorithm development.

What excites me about this role is the opportunity to contribute to next-generation networking, space systems, and signal processing technologies that have real-world impact. I’m particularly eager to grow in a multidisciplinary environment that encourages continuous learning, professional registration, and mentoring.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about contributing to BAE Systems' innovation-driven culture and look forward to the opportunity to bring value to your engineering team.
