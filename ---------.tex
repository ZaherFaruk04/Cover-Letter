\textbf{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\vspace{0.5cm}

I am writing to express my interest in the Graduate Software Engineer role at Obsidian Security. I am currently completing a BSc in Physics at the University of Salford, where I have developed strong technical, analytical and problem solving skills through both my academic work and practical engineering projects. I am motivated by the opportunity to work across the software stack, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to real systems that have meaningful impact in security technology.

During my degree I have gained experience in Python, C++ and MATLAB through a range of technical projects. These include simulating chaotic systems in MATLAB, modelling physical interactions in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib, and developing a working drone system programmed in C++ using Arduino. These projects strengthened my ability to design, implement and optimise code, as well as work with data pipelines, numerical methods and hardware integration. More recently, my quantum computing project has given me hands-on experience with cloud based platforms such as IBM Quantum and Microsoft Azure, which taught me how to work with modern APIs and cloud infrastructure.

Outside my academic work, my experience as a Computer Technician helped me build practical troubleshooting skills, attention to detail and an understanding of system behaviour at a low level. I believe these experiences align well with Obsidian Security's emphasis on curiosity, experimentation and understanding how systems work in depth.

I am particularly excited by the opportunity to explore areas such as full stack development, data engineering and distributed systems. I am comfortable with Python and I am keen to expand into technologies such as React, PostgreSQL, Kafka and containerisation tools like Docker and Kubernetes. The prospect of working in a hybrid team environment, learning from senior engineers and contributing to a platform that protects organisations worldwide strongly motivates me.

Obsidian Security's mission to secure SaaS applications resonates with my interest in emerging technology and my desire to work in areas that require both creativity and rigorous engineering. I am confident that my technical foundation, willingness to learn and enthusiasm for problem solving make me a strong fit for this graduate role.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your team.
