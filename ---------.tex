\vspace{1.5em}

\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,

\noindent I am writing to apply for the Graduate Software Engineering Programme at Thales in Stockport. As a Physics graduate from the University of Salford with a strong foundation in computational modelling and hardware integration, I am eager to contribute to high impact engineering projects within the defence and aerospace sector. My academic background has equipped me with the mathematical rigour and problem solving mindset required to excel in the complex software development environments that Thales is known for.

\noindent Throughout my degree and personal projects, I have demonstrated significant technical initiative. I engineered a custom drone using an Arduino based flight controller. This project required writing and debugging C++ code to handle real time sensor data and motor outputs while overcoming hardware interference issues. Additionally, my work with MATLAB to simulate chaotic systems required a meticulous approach to accuracy and algorithm design. I understand that Thales operates in industries where total precision is non-negotiable, and my experience in physics has trained me to ensure that every calculation and line of code is verified for reliability and safety.

\noindent The opportunity to rotate through various business units at Thales is particularly appealing to me. I enjoy the challenge of adapting to new technical environments and learning from senior experts. My personal values of resilience and discipline, cultivated through dedicated training in Kyokushin karate and MMA, align with the core values of excellence and teamwork expected at a leading technology firm. I am a proactive learner who thrives when solving difficult problems under pressure and remains committed until a successful solution is found.

\noindent I am fully able to meet the requirement for on-site work in Stockport and look forward to being a consistent, reliable presence within your engineering teams. I am excited about the possibility of joining your programme and developing my career as a Software Engineer at Thales. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my background with you further.
