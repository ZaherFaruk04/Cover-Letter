\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager\\Siemens UK}

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to express my interest in the Finance \& Commercial Graduate Programme at Siemens. I recently completed a BSc in Physics at the University of Salford, where I gained experience working on projects such as programming quantum computers, simulating chaotic systems in MATLAB, and modelling complex physical systems in Python. These projects strengthened my analytical skills, problem-solving ability, and attention to detail, which I believe are directly relevant to finance and commercial analysis.

I am drawn to Siemens because of the opportunity to gain practical experience across different placements and contribute to meaningful business projects. I am motivated, adaptable, and eager to work with diverse teams while continuing to develop my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.

I would welcome the chance to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to the Finance \& Commercial Graduate Programme at Siemens.

\closing{Yours sincerely,\\[2ex]Zaher Faruk}
