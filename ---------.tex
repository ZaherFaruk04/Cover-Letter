\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager\\Siemens UK}

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am excited to apply for the Finance \& Commercial Graduate Programme at Siemens. I recently completed my BSc in Physics at the University of Salford, where I developed strong analytical, numerical, and data-handling skills through projects including programming quantum computers, simulating chaotic systems in MATLAB, and modelling complex physical systems in Python. These experiences have strengthened my ability to approach problems logically, interpret data effectively, and deliver clear insights—skills directly transferable to finance and commercial analysis.

I am particularly drawn to Siemens for the opportunity to gain hands-on experience across multiple placements while developing technical and commercial expertise in a global, innovative environment. I am motivated, adaptable, and eager to contribute to real business challenges, collaborate with diverse teams, and continuously learn.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and determination to the Finance \& Commercial Graduate Programme at Siemens.

\closing{Yours sincerely,\\[2ex]Zaher Faruk}
