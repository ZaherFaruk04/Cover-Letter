\noindent \textbf{RE: Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Application}

\vspace{1em}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Junior Cybersecurity Analyst position at How to Job Ltd. With a BSc in Physics from the University of Salford and an A Level in Computer Science, I possess the analytical rigor and technical foundation necessary to excel in a 24/7 Security Operations Centre. My background in complex system simulation and hardware troubleshooting aligns closely with the investigative nature of threat monitoring and incident response.

During my time as a Computer Technician at Microtech Computers, I developed a deep understanding of system architecture through OS installations and BIOS configurations. This practical experience is complemented by my project work, where I engineered a drone using C++ and Arduino. This required precise debugging and an understanding of how hardware and software interface, a skill set that is directly transferable to configuring security tools like firewalls and EDR agents.

My current work in quantum computing and chaotic system simulation using MATLAB and Python has honed my ability to identify patterns within large datasets. In a cybersecurity context, this translates to efficient alert assessment and the ability to distinguish between false positives and genuine threats. I am a proactive learner who is eager to transition my problem-solving skills into the cyber defense sector, specifically within the financial and telecom sectors you protect.

I am particularly excited about the mentorship opportunities and the annual training budget offered by How to Job Ltd. I am committed to continuous professional development and aim to achieve my Security+ certification within my first year. The opportunity to contribute to your Manchester-based team and defend mission-critical systems is exactly the challenge I am looking for.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you in an interview.

Zaher Faruk
