\begin{letter}{Hiring Manager\\Stantec UK\\Leeds}

\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

I am writing to apply for the Graduate Civil Engineer position in Water at Stantec. I recently completed my BSc in Physics at the University of Salford, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills through projects such as programming quantum computers, simulating chaotic systems in MATLAB, and modelling complex physical systems in Python. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to interpret data, analyse patterns, and deliver clear and precise solutions, skills which I believe are directly applicable to civil and water engineering projects.

I am particularly drawn to Stantec because of the opportunity to work on high-profile water projects and contribute to solutions that benefit communities. I am motivated, adaptable, and collaborative, eager to learn from multidisciplinary teams while applying my technical skills to support project delivery. My resilience and determination, honed through both academic and personal pursuits, give me the confidence to tackle challenges effectively.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to Stantec’s projects and grow as part of your 2026 Graduate Programme.

\closing{Yours sincerely,\\[2ex]Zaher Faruk}
