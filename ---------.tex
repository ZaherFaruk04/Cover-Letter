\textbf{Subject: Application for Graduate Technology Architecture Programme} \\
\vspace{0.3cm}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Graduate Technology Architecture Programme at Severn Trent. As a FTSE 100 company with a leading, all-encompassing technology department, your focus on developing graduates into specialists in Solution Architecture and Cloud Architecting is an ideal match for my skills and ambitions.

My degree in \textbf{BSc (Hons) in Physics}, supported by an A-Level in \textbf{Computer Science}, has equipped me with an advanced "systems thinking" mindset. My academic background is rooted in deconstructing complex, interconnected systems (from quantum to chaotic dynamics) and modelling their behaviour, a skillset that directly aligns with the "solution mindset" and design-decision capabilities required for technology architecture.

My practical project work provides direct experience for this role's technical demands:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cloud Platform Exposure:} My latest project, \textbf{Programming Quantum Computers}, has given me hands-on experience using \textbf{Microsoft Azure}, one of the key cloud platforms you specified.
    \item \textbf{Troubleshooting Distributed Systems:} In my \textbf{Drone Engineering} project, I developed control algorithms in \textbf{C++} and diagnosed complex faults across interconnected software (Arduino) and hardware (ESCs, flight controller) components. This maps directly to the "ability to analyse and troubleshoot technical issues across distributed systems" you are looking for.
    \item \textbf{CS Fundamentals \& Software Design:} I have a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, evidenced by my A-Level and my project work using \textbf{Python} and \textbf{MATLAB} to model data, implement algorithms (Lennard-Jones), and simulate system behaviour (Chaotic Systems).
    \item \textbf{Rapid Technical Learning:} My ability to self-teach and adapt to emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and its associated platforms, demonstrates the "willingness to learn" essential for this programme.
\end{itemize}

I am particularly drawn to the programme's rotational structure, especially the placements in the \textbf{Technical Architecture} and \textbf{Cyber} teams. I am eager to build on my foundational knowledge and learn the specific tools and frameworks (like IaC and networking principles) under your mentorship.

I am a strong communicator, as developed in my administrator role, and am keen to bring my analytical skills and passion for technology to a company making a tangible impact on communities and the environment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to Severn Trent.

Sincerely,

Zaher Faruk
