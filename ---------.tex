\noindent \textbf{To: The Graduate Recruitment Team, CGI} \\




\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{2mm}

I am writing to formally apply for the Technical Graduate Geospatial Software Engineer position at CGI. As a Physics graduate from the University of Salford with a strong background in software development and mathematical modelling, I am eager to contribute to the innovative geospatial solutions CGI provides. I am highly motivated by the opportunity to work with both ESRI and open-source technologies within CGI’s ownership-driven culture.

\noindent \textbf{Technical Projects and Applied Skills}

\vspace{2mm}

Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have demonstrated the technical versatility and analytical rigour required for this role:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Drone Engineering (C++, Fusion 360):} I took full ownership of the development lifecycle for a custom drone. I programmed flight control systems using C++ and implemented real-time algorithms, ensuring seamless hardware and software integration. This project required extensive troubleshooting and a disciplined approach to software engineering.
    \item \textbf{Quantum Computing (Azure, IBM Quantum):} I have gained practical experience with emerging technologies, including superconducting qubits and quantum annealing. Utilising Microsoft Azure for these complex tasks has prepared me for the cloud-based infrastructures used in modern geospatial platforms.
    \item \textbf{Chaotic System Simulation (MATLAB):} I utilised numerical ODE solvers to model and visualise non-analytic basins. This project highlights my ability to handle complex spatial data and perform the high-precision mathematical analysis essential for GIS applications.
    \item \textbf{Data Visualisation (Python, NumPy):} In my Lennard-Jones potential project, I processed large datasets to model interatomic forces. This experience with Python and data manipulation directly translates to the requirements of processing and visualising spatial data in ArcGIS or Leaflet.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Professional Value and Commitment}

\vspace{2mm}

My experience extends beyond technical projects into professional environments where I have refined my communication and operational skills:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Problem Solving:} My background in Physics has trained me to approach challenges with a structured, first-principles mindset, allowing me to debug complex software issues efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Operational Excellence:} Working as an Office Administrator and Computer Technician has taught me the importance of document management, process improvement, and system stability in a professional setting.
    \item \textbf{Security and Flexibility:} As a UK national meeting the security clearance requirements, I am fully prepared to work on sensitive government projects. I am flexible regarding travel and willing to work across your UK-wide offices.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}

CGI’s reputation as a top employer and its focus on empowering the next generation of innovators makes this programme the ideal start for my career. I am confident that my blend of programming expertise and mathematical insight will allow me to make an immediate impact as a partner at CGI.
