\makelettertitle

I am excited to apply for the graduate position within the Electronics and Engineering practices at Marks \& Clerk in Manchester, as advertised. I am currently completing a BSc in Physics at the University of Salford, expected to graduate in 2025, and I believe my academic background and project experience in physics and electronics align well with your team’s needs.

Through my degree, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in electronics and technology. Notably, I completed a drone engineering project where I designed and programmed a drone’s control system using Arduino, integrating both hardware and software elements. This involved circuit design, CAD modelling, and troubleshooting of both hardware and software components, which has equipped me with strong practical electronics skills. Additionally, I have cultivated my skills in computational simulations and complex system analysis through projects like chaotic system modelling in MATLAB and quantum computing simulations with IBM Quantum and Microsoft Azure platforms.

I look forward to the opportunity to bring my technical background, curiosity, and drive for excellence to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I am excited to discuss how my skills and experiences could contribute to your team’s success.
