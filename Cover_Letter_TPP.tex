I am excited to be applying for the role of Graduate Technical Engineer at TPP. Having a physics and computational modelling background, I possess an analytical approach to solving complex technical problems. Your company's emphasis on innovation and precision appeals to my solid grasp of mathematical modelling, system deployment, and emerging technologies.

A student presently reading BSc in Physics at The University of Salford, I have developed expertise in MATLAB, Python, and C++, which I have applied to various projects in the simulation of chaotic systems, atomic interactions, and quantum computing. My dissertation concerns programming quantum computers, wherein I have researched superconducting qubits, photonic systems, and quantum annealing using frameworks like IBM Quantum, PennyLane, and Microsoft Azure. This project has reinforced my ability to work with complex algorithmic structures and optimize computational efficiency, key abilities in delivering seamless system integrations.

Beyond academic projects, my ability in designing and engineering a bespoke drone is an example of my competence in solving real-time programming issues, hardware debugging, and applying CAD modelling expertise using Fusion 360. Whatever involves using precise numerical solutions or optimising physical components for effectiveness, I solve problems in a structured and methodical manner.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to contribute my computational ability and problem-solving skills to TPP and to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs.
